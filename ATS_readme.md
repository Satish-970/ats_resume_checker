### üíª How to Run in Google Colab

The easiest way to use this project is through Google Colab, a free online environment that requires no local setup. Just follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Open the Notebook

Click the "Open in Colab" badge below to open the notebook directly in your browser.

[](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Satish-970/ATS_Checker_Job-Description/blob/main/ATS.ipynb)

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once the notebook is open, click on the first code cell and press the "Play" button (or `Shift + Enter`) to install all the necessary **Python libraries** like `spaCy`, `PyPDF2`, and `language-tool-python`. This may take a few moments.

*A screenshot of the Colab output showing dependencies being installed would go here.*

#### Step 3: Define Functions

Run the second code cell. This cell defines all the core functions for text extraction, keyword analysis, grammar checking, and score calculation. You'll see a confirmation message once it's complete.

#### Step 4: Run the ATS Checker


Execute the third and final code cell. You will be prompted to:

  * **Upload your resume**: A file dialog will appear, allowing you to select your resume (PDF or DOCX) from your computer. üìÇ
  * **Paste the job description**: A text box will appear. You can either paste a job description for a detailed **ATS analysis** or leave it blank to get a general resume health check. üìã

#### Step 5: Review the Results

After providing your input, the tool will process your resume and display a comprehensive report right in the Colab notebook. The report includes your **ATS score**, keyword matching details, and personalized suggestions for improvement.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

The project uses several key **Python libraries** to function:

  * **`PyPDF2` & `python-docx`**: These libraries handle the text extraction from your uploaded resume files.
  * **`spaCy`**: A powerful NLP (Natural Language Processing) library used for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging to intelligently identify important keywords.
  * **`scikit-learn`**: The `TfidfVectorizer` and `cosine_similarity` modules are used to convert text into numerical vectors and calculate the similarity score between your resume and the job description.
  * **`language-tool-python`**: This library is integrated for performing a thorough grammar and spelling check on your resume.
  * **`Matplotlib`**: Used to generate the visualization of your **ATS score**, giving you a clear visual overview of your results.
